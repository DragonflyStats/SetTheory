Cartesian Product / Cross Product
The Cartesian product of n number of sets A1,A2,…AnA1,A2,…An denoted as A1×A2⋯×AnA1×A2⋯×An can be defined as all possible ordered pairs (x1,x2,…xn)(x1,x2,…xn) where x1∈A1,x2∈A2,…xn∈Anx1∈A1,x2∈A2,…xn∈An
Example − If we take two sets A={a,b}A={a,b} and B={1,2}B={1,2},

The Cartesian product of A and B is written as − A×B={(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)}A×B={(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)}
The Cartesian product of B and A is written as − B×A={(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b)}B×A={(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b)}
