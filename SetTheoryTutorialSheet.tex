\subsection*{Dice Rolls}
Consider rolls of a die. What is the universal set?

\[ \mathcal{U} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \]

%--------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Worked Example}

Suppose that the Universal Set $\mathcal{U}$ is the set of integers from 1 to 9.
\[ \mathcal{U} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, \]

and that the set $\mathcal{A}$ contains the prime numbers between 1 to 9 inclusive.

\[ \mathcal{A} = \{1,2,3,5,7\}, \]

and that the set $\mathcal{B}$ contains the even numbers between 1 to 9 inclusive.

\[ \mathcal{B} = \{2,4,6,8\}. \]

%--------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection*{Complements}
\begin{itemize}

\item The Complements of A and B are the elements of the universal set not contained in A and B.

\item The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$
\[ \mathcal{A}^{\prime} = \{4,6,8,9\}, \]
\[ \mathcal{B}^{\prime} = \{1,3,5,7,9\}, \]

\end{itemize}
