\section{Bell Numbers}
Bell numbers give the count of the number of ways to partition a set. 
They are denoted by $B_n$ where n is the cardinality of the set.

\subsection{Example}

Let $S={1,2,3}$, $n=|S|=3$
The alternate partitions are −

1. $∅,{1,2,3}$

2. ${1},{2,3}$

3. ${1,2},{3}$

4. ${1,3},{2}$

5. ${1},{2},{3}$

Hence $B_3=5$
