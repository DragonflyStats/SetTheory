Describe the following set by the listing method the set of positive multiples of 3 which are less than 20.
Let A and B be subsets of universal set U. Use the membership rule to prove that
(A^\prime  \cap B)^\prime = A \cup B^\prime
Shade the region corresponding to this set on a Venn Diagram

Given the universal set \mathcal{U} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and the subsets A=\{1,3,5,7\}
B = \{6,7,8,9} list the set A^\prime \cap B)^\prime
