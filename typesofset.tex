\subsection{Types of Sets}
Sets can be classified into many types. Some of which are finite, infinite, subset, universal, proper, singleton set, etc.

\subsection{Finite Set}
A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set.

Example − \[S={x|x∈NS={x|x∈N and 70>x>50}70>x>50}\]
\subsection{Infinite Set}
A set which contains infinite number of elements is called an infinite set.

Example − S={x|x∈NS={x|x∈N and x>10}x>10}
\subsection{Subset}
A set X is a subset of set Y (Written as X⊆YX⊆Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y.

Example 1 − Let, X={1,2,3,4,5,6}X={1,2,3,4,5,6} and Y={1,2}Y={1,2}. Here set Y is a subset of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. Hence, we can write Y⊆XY⊆X.

Example 2 − Let, X={1,2,3}X={1,2,3} and Y={1,2,3}Y={1,2,3}. Here set Y is a subset (Not a proper subset) of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. Hence, we can write Y⊆XY⊆X.

\subsection{Proper Subset}
The term “proper subset” can be defined as “subset of but not equal to”. A Set X is a proper subset of set Y (Written as X⊂YX⊂Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y and |X|<|Y||X|<|Y|.

Example − Let, X={1,2,3,4,5,6}X={1,2,3,4,5,6} and Y={1,2}Y={1,2}. Here set Y⊂XY⊂X since all elements in YY are contained in XX too and XX has at least one element is more than set YY.

\subsection{Universal Set}
It is a collection of all elements in a particular context or application. All the sets in that context or application are essentially subsets of this universal set. Universal sets are represented as UU.

Example − We may define UU as the set of all animals on earth. In this case, set of all mammals is a subset of UU, set of all fishes is a subset of UU, set of all insects is a subset of UU, and so on.

\subsection{Empty Set or Null Set}
An empty set contains no elements. It is denoted by ∅∅. As the number of elements in an empty set is finite, empty set is a finite set. The cardinality of empty set or null set is zero.

Example − \[S={x|x∈NS={x|x∈N and 7<x<8}=∅7<x<8}=∅\]
\subsection{Singleton Set or Unit Set}
Singleton set or unit set contains only one element. A singleton set is denoted by {s}{s}.

Example − S={x|x∈N, 7<x<9}S={x|x∈N, 7<x<9} = {8}{8}
\subsection{Equal Set}
If two sets contain the same elements they are said to be equal.

Example − If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={6,1,2}B={6,1,2}, they are equal as every element of set A is an element of set B and every element of set B is an element of set A.

\section{Equivalent Set}
If the cardinalities of two sets are same, they are called equivalent sets.

Example − If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={16,17,22}B={16,17,22}, they are equivalent as cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B. i.e. |A|=|B|=3|A|=|B|=3
\subsection{Overlapping Set}
Two sets that have at least one common element are called overlapping sets.

In case of overlapping sets −

n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A∩B)n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A∩B)
n(A∪B)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A∩B)n(A∪B)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A∩B)n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A∩B)
n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A∩B)n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
Example − Let, A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={6,12,42}B={6,12,42}. There is a common element ‘6’, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

\section{Disjoint Set}
Two sets A and B are called disjoint sets if they do not have even one element in common. Therefore, disjoint sets have the following properties −

n(A∩B)=∅n(A∩B)=∅
n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)
Example − Let, A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={7,9,14}B={7,9,14}, there is not a single common element, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

\section*{Complement of a Set}
%(2.3.1) 
Consider the universal set $U$ such that
\[U=\{2,4,6,8,10,12,15\} \]
For each of the sets $A$,$B$,$C$ and $D$, specify the complement sets.
