Set Operations
Set Operations include Set Union, Set Intersection, Set Difference, Complement of Set, and Cartesian Product.

\subsection{Set Union}
The union of sets A and B (denoted by A∪BA∪B) is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. Hence, A∪B={x|x∈A OR x∈B}A∪B={x|x∈A OR x∈B}.

Example − If A={10,11,12,13}A={10,11,12,13} and B = {13,14,15}{13,14,15}, then A∪B={10,11,12,13,14,15}A∪B={10,11,12,13,14,15}. (The common element occurs only once)

%=========================================%
\subsection{Set Intersection}
The intersection of sets A and B (denoted by A∩BA∩B) is the set of elements which are in both A and B. Hence, A∩B={x|x∈A AND x∈B}A∩B={x|x∈A AND x∈B}.

Example − If $A={11,12,13}$ and $B={13,14,15}$$, then $A∩B={13}$.


%=========================================%
\subsection{Set Difference/ Relative Complement}
The set difference of sets A and B (denoted by A–BA–B) is the set of elements which are only in A but not in B. Hence, A−B={x|x∈A AND x∉B}A−B={x|x∈A AND x∉B}.

Example − If $A={10,11,12,13}$$ and B={13,14,15}B={13,14,15}, then (A−B)={10,11,12}(A−B)={10,11,12} and $(B−A)={14,15}$. Here, we can see (A−B)≠(B−A)(A−B)≠(B−A)Set Difference


%=========================================%
Complement of a Set
The complement of a set A (denoted by A′A′) is the set of elements which are not in set A. Hence, A′={x|x∉A}A′={x|x∉A}.

More specifically, A′=(U−A)A′=(U−A) where UU is a universal set which contains all objects.

Example − If A={x|x belongstosetofoddintegers}A={x|x belongstosetofoddintegers} then A′={y|y doesnotbelongtosetofoddintegers}A′={y|y doesnotbelongtosetofoddintegers}Complement Set

\begin{itemize}
	\item Union ($\cup$) - also known as the \textbf{OR} operator. A union signifies a bringing together. The union of the sets A and B consists of the elements that are in either A or B.
	\item Intersection ($\cap$) - also known as the \textbf{AND} operator. An intersection is where two things meet. The intersection of the sets A and B consists of the elements that in both A and B.
	\item Complement ($A^{\prime}$ or $A^{c}$) - The complement of the set A consists of all of the elements in the universal set that are not elements of A.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise}
Consider the universal set $U$ such that
\[U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \]

\subsection*{Union and intersection of sets}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{union} of two sets A and B is a set containing all the elements in
either A or B (or both)
i.e. 
\[A \cup B = {x / x \in A \mbox{ or } x \in B}.\]
\item The \textbf{intersection} of two sets A and B is a set containing all the elements
that are both in A and B
i.e. 
\[A \cap B = {x / x \in A \mbox{ and }x \in B}\].

\item If sets A and B have no elements in common, i.e. $A \cap B = \emptyset$,then A and B
are termed \textbf{disjoint sets}.
\end{itemize}
\newpage

%--------------------------------------------------------%

\subsubsection*{Intersection}
\begin{itemize}

\item Intersection of two sets describes the elements that are members of both the specified Sets

\item The intersection is denoted $\mathcal{A\cap B}$ 
\[ \mathcal{A\cap B} = \{2\}\]

\item only one element is a member of both A and B.
\end{itemize}
%--------------------------------------------------------%

\subsubsection*{Set Difference}
\begin{itemize}

\item The Set Difference of A with regard to B are list of elements of A not contained by B.

\item The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A-B}$ and $\mathcal{B-A}$
\[ \mathcal{A-B} = \{1,3,5,7\}, \]

\[ \mathcal{B-A} = \{4,6,8\}, \]

\item There are 4 elements in set A.
\item The power set of A contains 16 element data sets.
\item \[  \mathcal{P}(A) = \{\{ x \}, \{ y \} \}  \]
\item (i.e. 1 null set, 4 single element sets, 6 two -elemnts sets, 4 three lement set and one 4- element set.)

\section{Set operations}

Suppose X and Y are sets. Various operations allow us to build new sets from them.

\begin{description}
\item[Union]
The union of X and Y, written $X\cup Y$, contains all the elements in X and all those in Y. Thus $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, red, green, blue\}$. As A is a subset of E, the set $A \cup E$ is just E.

\item[Intersection]

The intersection of X and Y, written X∩Y, contains all the elements that are common to both X and Y. Thus {1,2,3,red,green,blue} ∩ {2,4,6,8,10} = {2}.

\item[Set difference]

The difference X minus Y, written X−Y or $X\|Y$, contains all those elements in X that are not also in Y. For example, E−A contains all integers greater than 3. A−B is just A; red, green and blue were not elements of A, so no difference is made by excluding them.
\end{description}

\subsection{Important Operations in Set Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item Union ($\cup$) - also known as the OR operator. A union signifies a bringing together. The union of the sets A and B consists of the elements that are in either A or B.
\item Intersection ($\cap$) - also known as the AND operator. An intersection is where two things meet. The intersection of the sets A and B consists of the elements that in both A and B.
\item Complement ($^{c}$) - The complement of the set A consists of all of the elements in the universal set that are not elements of A.

\section{Differences and complements}


	\begin{itemize}
		\item If A and B are sets then the difference set A − B is the set of all elements
		of A which do not belong to B.
		\item If B is a sub-set of A, then A − B is sometimes called the complement of
		B in A. When A is the universal set one may simply refer to the
		complement of B to denote all things not in B. \item The complement of a set A
		is denoted as $A^c$ or $A^{\prime}$.
	\end{itemize}
